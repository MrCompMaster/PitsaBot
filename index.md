# Woah Oh, Who is there!
Hello, fellow user fo PitsaBot! Trying to find some help over here? Here I, SergSel2006, Presonally will answer some of your questions

## Overview
Bot now don't have much commands, just see help for all 8 commands that I implemented nowadays. It is moderation commands only.

### What? So why it should be recommended for me?
OK, stay with us, this is an open-souce bot what will replace functionality of 2 or 3 bots, OK? You CAN help us to reach this idea. Now bot even cannot do much that normal bots can, but with some help over here, it will grow up!

## What about me?
Are you asking? I am learned Python from scratch using only its documentation and learned discord.py same way! What else you should know? Oh, Check out my GitHub page if you want to.

## What about bot?
A PisaBot is in very early development and good help is required. You can invite my bot by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=869082304033751120&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fsergsel2006.github.io%2FpitsaBot%2F&response_type=code&scope=bot%20guilds.members.read%20messages.read). I'll be glad to see another server to have this bot and this will give me power to work with it.
