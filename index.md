### What? So why it should be recommended for me?
OK, stay with us, this is an open-souce bot what will replace functionality of 2 or 3 bots, OK? You CAN help us to reach this idea. Now bot even cannot do much that normal bots can, but with some help over here, it will grow up!

## What about me?
Are you asking? I am learned Python from scratch using only its documentation and learned discord.py same way! What else you should know? Oh, Check out my GitHub page if you want to.

## What about bot?
A PisaBot is in very early development and good help is required. You can invite my bot by clicking [here](). I'll be glad to see another server to have this bot and this will give me power to work with it.
